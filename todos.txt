Add new store account type : {
    > this account can create parcels headed to the local office where dispatchers can then pick them up
    > the parcel this store creates has three properties {storeName:string,storeAddress:string,local:boolean}, which are not required in the parcelType
    > the account holder is similar to admin account but only scoped to his type of parcels
        > can see all local parcels that share his store name, this allows several store to share name but not storeAddress
        > can delete parcels that are unconfirmed or haven't been picked up yet ("Awaiting Confirmation" || "Awaiting Pickup")
        > can not update parel status or delete them after they have been picked up
        > can see who's delivering the object but do not have access to their data
    > this account may later be allowed to create local dispatcher accounts
} **Completed

Native base selector causes lags and must be replaced 

Admin should be able to unconfirm a parcel if a dispatcher takes too long to pick up the parcel: {
    >  This can be set to a default time ~ 24H or 
       add an option for dispatcher to provide an estimate time for arrival aswell as a cancel button
}

Admin can convert a store parcel for dispatchers to see

Admin should be able to edit any parcel

Add notifications for new parcels <-- code added but requires a push service
