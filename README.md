delivery solution for local delivery management.

App will track and manage deliveries with preset status.

The intended usage is something like this: 
    Admin creates a pending delivery --> freelance dispatchers will recieve a pending request --> a dispatcher accepts the task and updates the status as he goes
    
This app currently uses firebase firestor/auth during the testing phase in hopes for its own RESTFul api in the future.
